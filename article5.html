                   <p>As an independent <span>Promoter of SAFIR</span>, the duty of knowing our products (with their advantages and
                    qualities) and our brand is an <span>essential part of the promotion work</span>, plus the study and
                    understanding of what one is promoting.</p>
                    <p>Since blockchain technology is a very important part of our product portfolio, from SAFIR we want to
                        share the basic general notions that <span>our Promoters should know before</span> even inquiring about the
                        blockchain products of our promotion network.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the fundamental and first question that we must ask ourselves is:</p>
                    <h3>What is blockchain and how does it work?</h3>
                    <p><span>Blockchain, or “chain of blocks”</span>, is a technology in its infancy (as opposed to the line of human
                        technological progress), which <span>could well be compared to a distributed digital ledger that stores
                        data of any kind</span>. What do we mean by this? <span>In a chain of blocks, you can record information</span>
                        about cryptocurrency transactions, ownership of NFTs, automatic Smart contracts, deposits or
                        deliveries, and DeFi voting, among many other possibilities.</p>
                    <p>If we compare it with the traditional recording and recording system in any industry or company today,
                        <span>instead of being kept in one location, by a centralized administrator</span> (as it happens with an Excel
                        sheet or a bank database), <span>many Identical copies of a blockchain database are stored in several
                        computers, called nodes</span>, which are distributed in a network of computers that corroborate this data
                        and participate in its annotation in an anonymous and totally public way. <span>The “nodes” are
                        computers that execute the registration action</span>, in a public but anonymous system, where
                        everyone participates in each data record, and no one is the full owner of the record itself.</p>
                    <p>The nomenclature suggests that the name of the technology, blockchain, is no accident: this <span>“digital
                        ledger” is often described as a “chain”</span> made up of individual “blocks” of data interconnected in a
                        single story. As new data is periodically added to the network, a new "block" is created and attached
                        to the "chain". This process contemplates that <span>all nodes must constantly update their version of
                        the blockchain “ledger”</span> so that it is identical in all “controllers”.</p>
                    <p>The way in which each of these new blocks is created is key to explaining why the <span>Blockchain is
                        considered a highly secure and "incorruptible" technology</span>. Most nodes must verify and confirm
                        the legitimacy of the new data before a new block can be added to the ledger. If we are talking about
                        a cryptocurrency, this technology may <span>involve making sure that new transactions in a block are
                        not fraudulent</span> or that the coins have not been spent more than once.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <span>cryptocurrency transactions are protected by cryptography</span> and must be processed
                        by the nodes, which solve them through complex mathematical equations. What protocols like Bitcoin
                        tend to do is <span>reward the effort involved in validating this shared data</span> with new cryptocurrencies.</p>
                    <p>It is worth mentioning that <span>there are public and private blockchains</span>. On a public blockchain,
                        anyone can participate, which means they can read, write, or audit the data on the blockchain.
                        Therefore, <span>it is very difficult to alter the transactions recorded on a public blockchain, since no
                        authority controls the nodes</span>.</p>
                    <p>Private blockchains are controlled by an organization or group, which can <span>decide who is invited into
                        the system and have the authority to go back and tamper with the blockchain</span>. This private
                        blockchain process is more similar to an internal data storage system, except that it is distributed
                        across multiple nodes to increase security.</p>

                    <h3>What is the blockchain used for?</h3>
                    <p>Blockchain technology is used for many different purposes, from <span>providing financial services to
                        managing voting systems</span>.</p>
                    <p>Although blockchain could be used to store any type of information and to perform reliable verification
                        of a person's identity, the <span>most frequent uses of blockchain</span> today are in the following areas:</p>
                    <ul class="ar-numer">
                        <li><span>Cryptocurrencies in general:</span> The most common use of blockchain today is storing and recording
                            data related to cryptocurrency transactions. The more people use cryptocurrencies, the more
                            widespread the blockchain becomes.</li>                            
                        <li><span>Banking System:</span> In addition to the widespread use of cryptocurrencies, blockchain is being used
                            to process transactions in fiat currencies, such as dollars and euros, known in the industry as "fiat"
                            currency. This could streamline these operations, since they can be verified more quickly and
                            processed outside normal business hours without the need for or dependence on a person, also
                            eliminating the margin of error that this entails.</li>
                        <li><span>Asset Transfers:</span> Blockchain can also be used to record and transfer ownership of different assets.
                            This is currently very popular with digital assets such as NFTs, a representation of digital art, and
                            video ownership. However, blockchain could also be used to process ownership of real-life assets,
                            such as deeds to real estate and vehicles. The blockchain would make it possible to verify the identity
                            and ownership of a person in order to transfer the title deed without manually submitting
                            documentation, which would be instantly updated on the blockchain.</li>
                        <li><span>Smart Contracts:</span> Another blockchain innovation is self-executing contracts, commonly called
                            "smart contracts." These digital contracts are automatically executed once the conditions are met.</li>                            
                        <li><span>Supply Chain Monitoring:</span> Supply chains involve massive amounts of information, especially
                            when goods go from one part of the world to another. Storing this information on the blockchain
                            makes it easy to go back and monitor the supply chain.</li>
                        <li><span>Voting Systems:</span> Experts are looking for ways to apply blockchain to prevent voting fraud. In
                            theory, blockchain voting would allow people to submit votes that could not be tampered with and
                            would eliminate the need for people to verify their identity or count votes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Types of Blockchains</h3>
                    <p>Given the characteristics of blockchain, it is easy to think which are the sectors in which this
                        technology has the most room and future: </p>
                    <ul class="ar-numer">
                        <li><span>Banking:</span> The banking sector was the first to incorporate the chain of blocks into its operational
                            processes since this technology was born in a transaction environment. Blockchain can facilitate the
                            commercialization of certain banking products and ensure the speed of operations, in addition to
                            avoiding fraud risks.</li>                            
                        <li><span>Insurance:</span> Blockchain allows more efficient management of payments and premium collections, in
                            addition to reducing operational costs by streamlining all processes. As already mentioned, the
                            blockchain is also very useful for detecting fraud and brings a lot of transparency to actions.</li>
                        <li><span>Telecommunications:</span> The chain of blocks offers a series of advantages associated with
                            authentication and security. Therefore, blockchain will have an impact on the telecommunications
                            sector, especially in relation to network and business management. It helps to improve the
                            competitiveness of the company and customer satisfaction.</li>
                        <li><span>Manufacturing:</span> Blockchain allows different companies associated with the same logistics process
                            to make safe and complete traceability of each stage of a product. In addition, the convenience of
                            smart contracts improves productivity and optimizes logistics processes.</li>
                        <li><span>Medicine:</span> Blockchain also makes it possible to easily follow the traceability of medicines. In
                            addition, it allows immediate and complete access to medical records, treatments, and identifications
                            by doctors, patients, and researchers. The chain of blocks favors the relationship between the patient
                            and health personnel, which allows a more direct and personalized link.</li>
                        <li><span>Business Audits:</span> Thanks to the qualities of the chain of blocks in terms of traceability and
                            transparency, any organization can audit its activity without the need to interfere in the business
                            processes in progress.</li>                            
                        <li><span>Media:</span> Thanks to blockchain, communication professionals can reach audiences directly, without
                            the need to go to intermediaries (media). On the other hand, content creators (not journalists) are
                            gaining more and more relevance, and more money, with the creation of their information. For
                            example, through the Steemit platform (based on blockchain), blog content creators receive payments
                            in cryptocurrencies based on the popularity of their information.</li>
                        <li><span>Public administration:</span> Several countries have already incorporated blockchain technology to
                            generate a decentralized national administration and improve the experience of employees and
                            inhabitants. For example, in Estonia, the blockchain is used to store tax information related to the
                            national productive sector and the health of its citizens. In Australia, this technology is used in
                            security, communications, and logistics activities.</li>
                        <li><span>Copyright:</span> Blockchain gives authors the ability to have more control over the unauthorized use of
                            their works. There are platforms (CoalaIP, Mediachain, Monegraph) that store the images and audio
                            owned by users in databases that allow the automatic distribution of said works upon receiving an
                            agreed payment. This technology allows authors to know when their works are used, thus being able
                            to maintain the registration of their intellectual property.</li>
                        <li><span>Online sales:</span> The chain of blocks allows the emergence of initiatives such as OpenBazaar, a
                            platform that uses blockchain to connect buyers directly with sellers, without intermediaries. For
                            example, banks can become tech companies with transactional software services, tech companies
                            develop platforms with non-bank banking functions, and phone companies become a kind of media
                            and identity management.</li>

                    <h3>Main Advantages of Blockchain</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the article, some of the advantages of blockchain have already been mentioned, but here
                        are the most important ones:</p>
                    <ul class="ar-numer">
                        <li><span>Increased transaction accuracy:</span> Because a blockchain transaction must be verified by several
                            nodes, this can reduce the error. Plus, each asset is individually identified and tracked on the
                            blockchain, so there's no chance of spending it twice.</li>                            
                        <li><span>No need for intermediaries:</span> Using the blockchain, two parties to a transaction can confirm and
                            complete something without the need for a third person or entity to mediate, saving time and money.</li>
                        <li><span>Additional security:</span> In theory, a decentralized network, such as a blockchain, makes it almost
                            impossible for someone to carry out fraudulent actions. To make forged transactions you would have
                            to hack every node and change every ledger or manage more than 50% of the nodes. While this is
                            not necessarily impossible, many cryptocurrency blockchain systems use proof-of-stake (PoS) or
                            proof-of-work (PoW) transaction verification methods, which make it difficult to conduct fraudulent
                            transactions.</li>
                        <li><span>More efficient transfers:</span> These operations can be carried out from anywhere and at any time, due
                            to the uninterrupted and unlimited operation of the blockchains.</li>                            
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Regulations of Blockchain and blockchain products</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the article, some of the advantages of blockchain have already been mentioned, but here
                        are the most important ones:</p>
                    <div class="post-link">
                    <p>As quoted from <a href="https://complyadvantage.com/insights/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-world/" target="_blank">https://complyadvantage.com/insights/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-world/</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Here is a general view of the crypto regulation situations around the world, as there is not yet a
                        singular global or hierarchical structure of international regulations that could reign over the local
                        ones.</p>
                    <div class="item"><img class="img-responsive1" src="assets/images/post/Article5/image5.jpg" alt="Safir"/></div>
                    <div class="post-link">
                    <p>As quoted from <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/future-of-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/future-of-cryptocurrency/</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What new regulation could mean for investors:</h3>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency regulation can be a hot button topic, but plenty of experts say it’s actually a good thing
                        for investors and the industry.</p>
                    <p>More regulation could mean more stability in a notoriously volatile crypto market. It also has the
                        potential to protect long-term investors, prevent fraudulent activity within the crypto ecosystem, and
                        provide clear guidance to allow companies to innovate in the crypto economy — as long as it strikes
                        the right balance.</p>
                    <p><span>“Sensible regulation is a win for everyone,”</span> says Ben Weiss, CEO and cofounder of CoinFlip, a
                        cryptocurrency buying platform and crypto ATM network. “It gives people more confidence in crypto,
                        but I think it's something we have to take our time on and we have to get it right.”</p>
                    <p>Regulatory announcements can also affect the price of cryptocurrency in already volatile markets.
                        Market volatility is why experts recommend keeping any cryptocurrency investments <span>to less than 5%
                        of your total portfolio and never investing anything you're not OK with losing</span>.”</p>
                    <div class="cursive">
                        <p>Blockchain as an industry is having a strong development, and It’s for this reason in general, that our
                            adoption of Blockchain Products for our portfolio is key to our success. In a short time to come, we will
                            see the adoption of the Blockchain in more and more types of solutions and applications, for which the
                            understanding of this technology now is an angular stone of the professional development as
                            Promoters in the future.</p>
