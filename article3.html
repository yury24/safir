                   <p>As the huge team that we are, with an incredible variety of people and dreams, with unique lifestyles
                    and stories; <span>in SAFIR we all have a possibility to achieve our success.</span></p>
                    <p>Be careful, we are not talking about success at a financial, personal, intellectual, spiritual, or economic
                        level, only... but about all the formats that success can present to each of the people that make up
                        <span>SAFIR.</span> In other words, success has as many variants as there are people in the world, and there’s a
                        specific way of success when referred to as<span> independent Promoters in Relational Marketing.</span></p>
                    <p>The definition of this word is somewhat abstract because it means something different depending on
                        each one.<span> For one person it may mean achieving the highest position in your company, while
                        for another success is staying calm and happy just the way you are.</span> </p>
                    <p>To make a bit of history, and broaden the spectrum of success that you may have;<span> from SAFIR we
                        have compiled</span> some of the most important phrases defining success, (and their authors are people
                        with clear life examples to support their thoughts!) that<span> have inspired us to achieve the level and
                        importance that SAFIR has today as Relational Marketing Network.</span></p>
                    <div>
                        <ul class="ar-numer">
                        <li>"People are not remembered by the number of times they fail, but by the number of times they
                            succeed." -Thomas Alva Edison.</li>
                            <p><span>Failures are taught in our culture as something to avoid, something to be ashamed of, and
                                above all something negative with no use.</span> In recent years we have seen more concrete and real
                                philosophies appear that understand the usefulness and natural necessity of failure as a prelude to
                                success. <span>You will never know how many times you will fail,</span> therefore resisting and continuing is a
                                vital formula to achieve your goals, and in the end, you will be remembered for your achievements,
                                since failures are many in each person and therefore they are not special or unique.</p>
                            <li>“To be successful, planning alone is insufficient. One must also improvise.” - Issac Asimov.</li>
                            <p>There is a black-and-white in everything that exists, and the balance of these poles is the key to being
                                really "strong" and achieving the objectives. <span>In the professional field, planning and improvisation
                                are the two preferred antonyms.</span> Having things excessively planned will make us get stuck and
                                stagnate in situations that are not preconceived or at least planned with room for variation. We will
                                then need constant improvisation, in any plan no matter how big or small, without losing the objective
                                (that is clear) but understanding that the path up close can seem sinuous and when we move away,
                                we see the straightest line. The world, and the circumstances that surround us, are changing. <span>We
                                must know how to adapt quickly and as far as possible, improvise.</span></p>
                            <li>"Success is learning to go from failure to failure without despair." -Winston Churchill.</li>
                            <p>In addition to the previous definition, a plan fails when it is no longer followed and a goal is impossible
                                when it is no longer pursued. <span>As long as you have clear goals,</span> a flexible plan, and are prepared to
                                face the chain of failures; success will be assured.<span> At SAFIR, we promote resilience as a personal</span>
                                tool, and perseverance as an attitude, since the key is to learn from our mistakes as true fields of
                                training and improvement, not throwing in the towel and not falling into despair in the face of setbacks.

                            <li>“I have failed over and over again in my life, that is why I have achieved success.” - Michael
                                Jordan.</li>
                            <p><span>Without mistakes, success cannot be achieved, without knowing what not to do, it is
                                impossible to touch perfection.</span></p>

                    <h3>What tasks make a successful promoter? </h3>
                    <p><span>If we want to apply success as a concept for Promoters of Direct Sells at SAFIR, let’s set the
                        concept of promoter first.</span> When talking about a promoter, refers to the promotion, which is defined
                        as the effort of execution through a trained team to be able to have in time, form, and visually the
                        exhibition of a product in direct and personalized distribution channels for a target audience.</p>
                    <p><span>Some habits and qualities make a promoter a successful one,</span> and also basic tasks that the
                        promoter must do to be a real one, and a good one:</p>
                    <div>
                        <ul class="ar-numer">
                            <li>Implement <span> promotional strategies for a brand</span> or product according to the direction of the
                                company</li>
                            <li><span>Execute elements that help the potential customer</span> to make their purchase decision such
                                as benefits, accessibility, warranty, availability, price, etc. of the brand or product</li>
                            <li><span>Advise during and after the purchase process,</span> as well as the resolution of previous doubts</li>
                            <li><span>To be the face of the brand in front of the public,</span> and the analyst of the consideration of
                                the public in the face of the company</li>
                            <li>Based on the functions mentioned above, part of the <span>characteristics of a good promoter</span> is
                                having a clear understanding of the execution guidelines of the brand or product. This will
                                translate into the<span> continuous search to establish the perfect point of sale</span> and the ideal
                                marketing development so that the <span>purchasing experience is favorable for the brand and
                                positive for the consumer.</span>

                        Marketing of SAFIR</h3>
                    <div>
                        <ul class="ar-numer">
                            <li><span>Set clear priorities for your day and week</span>
                            <p><span>Successful Promoters are clear about their priorities</span> and do what is most important. These
                                people know that what they do has consequences as well as when they don't. That is why it is better to be <span> effective in the appropriate tasks than efficient with small tasks</span> that are not so critical,
                                which gives a clear concept of task hierarchy.</p>
                            <p><span>The way to establish priorities may vary, but at SAFIR, we recommend that you do them in two
                                large groups, Urgent and Important.</span> What is urgent can be resolved in the morning, or at least
                                started, and by giving priority to these tasks, what is important can be left for the afternoon, with more
                                tranquility and calm for having started or completed what is urgent.</p></li>
                            <li><span>Take responsibility for your life in all its aspects</span>
                            <p>Never complain or blame others for their problems or their failures. Become owner of everything that
                                happens to you, which allows you to take action accordingly. Know that while you can't always control
                                everything that happens, <span>you can control how you react to these unexpected events.</span></p></li>
                            <li><span>Create your morning routine</span>
                            <p>The key to starting a productive day is to start it off on the right foot. <span>Choose tasks that motivate
                                and inspire you.</span> Look at the list of tasks for the day and start your activity with the ones you like the
                                most. There are people who, for example, are activated by playing sports first thing in the morning,
                                reading for breakfast... <span>Choose the ones that best fit you and start the day motivated.</span></p></li>
                            <li><span>Practice meditation or mindfulness</span>
                            <p>Almost 80% of the successful people analyzed confirm that they <span>practice some type of meditation</span>
                                exercise daily, be it yoga or mindfulness at some point in the day. This exercise in many cases does
                                not usually last more than 15 minutes.</p></li>
                            <li><span>Exercise regularly and eat healthily</span>
                            <p>They already said it at the time of the Roman Empire,<span> “mens sana in corpore sana”</span> (a healthy mind
                                in a healthy body). It has been shown that healthy eating habits and sports generate motivation,
                                satisfaction, and happiness in people.</p></li>
                            <div class="item"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/post/Article3/article35.jpg" alt=""/></div>
                            <li><span>Know yourself at every opportunity</span>
                            <p>People who stand out know their strengths and weaknesses well and put them into practice to
                                improve and develop them to the best of their ability. They are <span>self-confident but at the same time
                                humble.</span> After all, <span>if you know who you are, your strengths and not-so-strengths will be easier
                                to improve.</span> For these reasons, we recommended that you <span>do your own personal
                                “self-knowledge” exercise</span> by taking a pen and paper and start describing yourself first. Depending
                                on where you want to go, establish your lines of work accordingly so you get your objective done.</p></li>
                            <li><span>Read and learn constantly</span>
                            <p><span>Bill Gates reads an average of 50 books a year for example.</span> But, beware! With this, I do not mean
                                that reading for reading is good since it is essential to select which books are going to generate the
                                greatest impact, motivation, or enjoyment in you.<span> It is important to search for those worth reading
                                in your particular case.</span> As for training, whether self-taught or from third parties, it is one of the most
                                important foundations in professional development since no one is born knowing, and not everything
                                can be learned on the street. <span>This applies to all types of professions or activities</span> to develop in life,
                                however small or large they may be, as happens within all the<span> professionals at SAFIR.</span></p></li>
                            <li><span>Be consistent in your goals and do what you say</span>
                            <p><span>Successful Promoters are consistent and don't give up easily.</span> Take yourself seriously. If you
                                have proposed something, pursue it. Don't make excuses, pursue the result.</p></li>
                            <li><span>Have discipline and self-control in your day to day</span>
                            <p><span>Stay focused</span> and avoid deviating from the objectives and priorities set, although, with the
                                "super-connected" life that we lead, it is not easy at all.</p></li>
                            <li><span>Seek support, and guidance</span>
                            <p><span>Successful Promoters </span>have the support of other people, whether it's a partner, a friend, a family
                                member, a coach, or a mentor, they don't have to be many. In addition, it is <span>essential to surround
                                yourself with people with a fighting mind.</span></p>
                            <p>The proverb already says: <span>"Tell me who you hang out with and I'll tell you who you are"</span>, that is, if
                                you surround yourself with successful people, you will be successful too.</p></li>
                            <li><span>Actions more than ideas</span>
                            <p><span>These types of people not only set their goals but also make a detailed plan of action</span> to
                                achieve them. They are quite executing profiles, they make decisions with ease, and have large
                                doses of the initiative. If they want something they don't stand still waiting for it to be offered, but go
                                out and <span>go for it.</span></p></li>
                            <li><span>Value your time, which is your life</span>
                            <div class="item"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/post/Article3/article36.jpg" alt=""/></div>
                            <p>Successful people take great care of their time because they are interested in taking care of their life
                                and therefore, <span>time = life.</span> They are aware that it is a limited resource and that, therefore, every
                                second they spend on a task has a price.<span> Hence also the importance of delegating certain
                                activities that may not be where you offer the most value</span> and avoiding time thieves that will kill
                                your productivity.</p>
                            <p>To achieve success at all levels, we must remember that order, perseverance, and planning are
                                essential. Once these<span> habits are achieved daily, we can improve and grow solidly,</span> without
                                unpleasant surprises or foreseeable setbacks.</p>
                            <p><span>By achieving this level of peace of mind and productivity, we can truly build strong and lasting
                                relationships with your team and clients, without fear of errors or misunderstandings, thus
                                functioning as advisors to the client on the product and growing your Relational Marketing
                                Network at SAFIR.</span></p></li>
